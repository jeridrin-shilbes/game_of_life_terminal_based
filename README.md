# Conway's Game of Life ‚Äî Terminal Simulation in C

This repository contains a C implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a classic cellular automaton simulation. The simulation displays evolving generations of cells in the terminal, using Unicode characters to represent live and dead cells.

## üî¨ What is Conway's Game of Life?

It's a zero-player game where you set the initial state, and the system evolves over time according to specific rules:
- A cell survives if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.
- A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors.
- All other cells die or remain dead.

## üß† Main gist

- The simulation runs on a `100x100` grid.
- Initial live cell positions are specified in the `alive` array.
- Future iterations are aimed to have keypress integration to select the alive cell at the start of every iteration of sim
- The grid evolves for a predefined number of generations (`GENERATION_LIMIT`).(line 35 could be switched for a while loop to run simulations infinitely)
- Each generation is displayed in the terminal using:
  - `‚¨ú` for **live** cells
  - `‚¨õ` for **dead** cells
